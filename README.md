# Protekt Protocol
Protekt Protocol puts crypto to work insuring users against hacks, bugs, and exploits of any DeFi protocol. Just as Uniswap allows any token to have a swap market, Protekt allows any pooled capital to be insured by stakers. Its goal is to support and catalyze the growth of the DeFi ecosystem by protecting users from getting rekt.

Along with being an active DeFi protocol, an allocation of treasury reserves will be used to continually audit and secure other DeFi protocols, so the ecosystem can all grow safely together.

Building on the work of awesome projects like [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/), [DeFi Score](https://defiscore.io/), [Aave's Safety Modules](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), and others, we believe that large vulnerabilities are the **biggest risk to a thriving DeFi community** over the next few years, especially as new money legos are created and remixed weekly. As more capital flows into the space, token holders need signaling and assurance of the projects they can trust and commit capital as well as recapitalization if a [Shortfall Event](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/terminology#shortfall-event-se) occurs.

To fulfill this need, Protekt Protocol introduces a new insurance marketplace with several innovative features:
* Back any capital pool with a customizable insurance contract
* Wrapped tokens with built in coverage (never "buy cover")
* Staking pools with shield farming incentives
* Final liquidation pool owned and governed by a DAO.

Inspired by yearn, Aave, Compound, Balancer, Maker, rDAi, and others. The very best in DeFi.

## How it works
### pTokens, like cTokens but with cover
Users can deposit cTokens (or any pool share token, but weâ€™re starting with Compound for now) and get pTokens in return. The pToken represents your cToken 1:1 plus 90% of the COMP farming rewards, while the other 10% goes to the Protekt Pool for that cToken lending pool. pToken can be minted at any time and redeemed for your cTokens + adjusted COMP rewards at any time.

**In short, by holding a pToken, you pay 10% of your yield farming returns to be insured against a hacks, bugs, and exploits of the underlying pool.**

### Protekt Pools
Protekt pools can be set up on top of ANY DeFi pool, whether it's a lending pool, market making pool, staking pool, etc. This underlying pool is called the "Target pool", and ANYONE can set up a Protekt pool on top of it. Protekt pools earn fees from the Target Pool, primarily by taking a cut of yield farming rewards. Stakers can add value to the Protekt pool to cover the liability of the Target pool from a Shortfall event and earn a portion of the fees in return.

### The PKT Mothership Vault
The PKT Mothership Vault is the backstop that covers all Protekt Pools, governs which Target Pools are added and how, and will eventually earn cashflow for their contribution. New Protekt Pools can only be added through the Mothership. She creates life and give security.

## The PKT Token
The PKT token is the token of the Protekt Protocol. It will be used to make governance decisions, staked for assuming protocol liability, receive cashflows from fees, provided as a protocol incentive, and used to fund grants and audit reports for DeFi protocols that are covered by Protekt.

### Protocol Incentives (Yield Farming)
Every Wednesday "Windfall Wednesday", new rounds of PKT will be claimable by those providing capital or work into the protocol. Tasks that earn weekly PKT include:
* Shield Farming in a Protekt Pool
* Staking PKT, ETH, or DAI in the Mothership Vault
* Rewarded for fulfilling open Grants
* Rewarded for creating audit reports on other DeFi protocols

### Governance
Governance will start and end with the Protekt community. They will be the ones to propose coverage of new DeFi pools, adjust and critique settings, and keep DeFi safe at night.
